# Better Test

This library is a replacement for rackets `raco test` that has a few benefits. Namely, it can generate code coverage reports and it will return with a non-zero exit code if tests fail.

## How to install

install via `raco pkg install better-test`. To install for development, checkout the repo into a folder named `Better Test` and in the parent directory run `raco pkg install better-test/`.

If you're doing developement remember: better-test *cannot* run on itself.

## How to use

To view the arguments for Better Test run `raco better-test -h`.

Code coverage can be generated by specifying the `-c <format>` flag.
Right now the valid formats are: html and coveralls.
Using coveralls requires the "COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN" to be set, and needs bash and curl.
Travic-ci/Coveralls support coming soon...
The directory that the coverage is outputted to can be specified with the `-d` flag.

If any tests run by `rackunit` fail, Better Test will return with exit code `1`. If all tests pass it will return with exit code `0`.


## Internals

Better Test also comes with a racket API for running tests and generating coverage reports. Documentation coming soon...
